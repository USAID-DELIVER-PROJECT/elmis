angular-materialize
===================

**angular-materialize** in action http://krescruz.github.io/angular-materialize/

This library is a set of AngularJS directives, that makes is possible to use features from [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) with AngularJS. 

Just add the module ui.materialize to you dependencies like: 

    angular.module('angular-app', [
      'ui.materialize'
    ])
    
and then you are good to go. 

This is not to be confused with the [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) project, which is a standalone Material design implementation for AngularJS. 

We are on Bower, look for [`angular-materialize`](http://bower.io/search/?q=angular-materialize).
